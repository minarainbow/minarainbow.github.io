Bad habits in pronunciation tend to solidify easily, so raising meta-cognition and having repetitive exposure is needed. However in low-resource setting, solutions such as tutoring or automated system are not reliable due to low performance of Korean language models. To increase meta-cognition in pronunciation learning in a scalable way, our system assists users in peer evaluation for co-learning experiences.
