Hi! I am a 1st-year Ph.D. at [UT Austin Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/), advised by Prof. [Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com/). My research focuses on creating intelligent, accessible, and scalable systems to improve the effectiveness of audio/visual media.

I completed my B.Sc in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr/en/) where I was advised by Prof. [Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/) as part of [KIXLAB](https://www.kixlab.org/). Prior to my graduate studies, I was a research intern at [Naver AI Lab](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab).
